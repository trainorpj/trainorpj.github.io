					At a liberal arts college like Swarthmore, one interacts with incredible every day. The people that you eat with, that you run into at tutoring sessions, and who you make awkward eye contact with&mdash;they're going to do amazing things with their lives. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My hypothesis was that Swarthmore students have not only depth, but also breadth in their knowledge, and it's reflected in their coursework. I designed a graph that shows the courses a student at Swarthmore has taken, giving a snapshot of their interests. Ultimately, the visualization shows that different students have vastly different interests, a fact supported by what we see in each individual graph. Each student has a unique pattern that clearly shows what they've made of their time at Swarthmore. 
				</p>
				<p>
					While the visualization is still in the demo phase, I have spoken with the Swarthmore Admissions Department, and they said they would like to use my work. My intention is to treat it like Satyan Devadoss's visualization , by expressing the merits of the liberal arts approach to higher education through data visualization. I plan to implement this as an online brochure, so that students (both current and prospective) can use this tool to learn more about what a liberal arts education looks like.
