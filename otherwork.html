                        <p>This was my final assignment for my film Production class in the spring of 2015 (my junior year). I chose to do an adaptation of No One Writes to the Colonel by the late Gabriel García Márquez.</p>

                        <p>For the past few years Márquez's stories have captivated my imagination. He manages to make emotions and ideas palpable, giving the concepts of death, solitude, and guilt physical form. The amazing thing is how he does it: he develops
                            his characters and stories minimally, using powerful and strange details, but only in the most sparing manner.</p>

                        <p>I took this as an opportunity to mimic his style, to use only the slightest amount of detail to tell the complex history of these two characters. Márquez goes through 100 pages before getting to this scene, and I wanted to compress
                            that into five minutes. </p>

                        <p>This was the first film I worked on in my production course. The screenplay was written by another student, Garrett Bolin, and I directed it along with my friend Steve Sekula. It turned out to be really difficult, production-wise;
                            we had to change things in the script and we had to reschedule several times due to bad weather...thankfully our actors were able to adjust.</p>

                        <p>Overall I learned a lot from making this film, and I'm pretty happy with it. I definitely could have fixed it up before putting this out as the final product, but I didn't have the time, and I was already focusing on my next project
                            (the one above). </p>

                        I wrote and presented this paper for my Advanced Microeconomics seminar, which I took in the Spring of 2015 (my junior year). It discusses how two players settle wage disputes through a third-party arbitrator.

                        This was a research paper I did for a course on animation. Just as live-action film is filmed on a camera, so is animation, but there are fundamental differences in our understanding of the two. This paper introduces and discusses those differences.

                        This paper is in-progress. At Swarthmore, Honors Math majors like myself do not write a thesis, but instead take graduate entry-level exams at the end of their senior year. This is the thesis I would have written; it pertains to a promising field of Algebraic
                        Geometry called Tropical Geometry.
