These are meant to communicate an idea quickly. These are written (and coded) in a stream-of-conciousness fashion, and they're mostly a tool for me to get things done.\n\nProfessionally, I think most of my work is quick-and-dirty. If my manager asks for a quick analysis, I want to get them accurate results as quickly as possible. Nobody cares how clean/reusable my code is if nobody is sees it. Most of the time, cleaning up you python/SQL/whatever is not worth the effort.\n\n",
