This is an analysis of the [Chicken Noodle Cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/2d0fde97-e28c-4ba4-84fc-f271016e9578). This is a collection of Magic the Gathering cards I use to play with my friends. While this is a fufilling creative and social endeavor, it also presents me with a rich dataset.

I compiled the database ahead of time:

```
$ ./01-download-cards.sh
$ ./02-download-scryfall.sh
$ duckdb cube.duckdb < 01-create-views.sql
```

Now, onto the analysis! `cards` is the main table we're working with

```{python}
import duckdb
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

cube = duckdb.connect("cube.duckdb")
cube.query("select * from cards limit 1").to_df().iloc[0]
```

Mana curves:

```{python}
(
    cube.query("""
    select color_category, cmc as cmc
    from cards 
    where color_category != 'Lands'
    """)
    .to_df()
    .pipe(lambda df: sns.ecdfplot(data=df, x="cmc", hue="color_category"))
)
```
